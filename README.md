# Movie Industry Analysis

## Project Overview

Our company wants to enter the film industry by creating a new movie studio but they lack any knowledge on filmmaking. we are required to perform an analysis on the available movie datasets to determine to the types of movies that perform the best in terms of popularity and box office revenue.

## Objectives

-   To determine which genre of movies is the most popular but also yields high revenue.
-   To determine which genre of movies is the most popular.
-   To determine which genre of movies generates the most revenue.
-   To evaluate the relationship between movie budgets and box office revenue.
-   To examine the correlation between ratings and revenue.

## Tools Used

-   **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
-   **Tableau** for interactive visualizations
-   **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis

## Key Findings

-   Movies released in the month of June tend to perform well than movies released in other months.
-   As the average rating increases the worldwide revenue also increases slightly meaning there is a weak correlation.
-   As the production budget increases the worldwide revenue also increases but other factors also contribute.
-   ROI tends to drop for movies with excessively high budgets.
-   Ratings tend to cluster around 6-7, but outliers in niche genres
    exist.

    ```

2.  Open `movie_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter to view the Python-based
    analysis.

3.  Open `Movie_Industry_Analysis_Presentation.pptx` for a summary of

## Recommendations

-   Prioritize producing AdventureDramaSci-Fi and ActionAdventureSci-Fi movies, which not only perform well in terms of worldwide  gross revenue but also attract high audience engagement.
-   CrimeDramaFamily and DramaFantasyMusical are the best options to venture into when working with a small budget since they require a small budget on average but generate huge profits.
-   FamilyFantasyMusical and AdventureDramaSport genres are the best options to venture into with a sizable budget since they require large budgets but generate huge profits.
-   Release movies mainly in June as this is the month where movies released generate the most revenue more than any other month.
